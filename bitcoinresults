3289  &lt;p&gt;What protocols or algorithms are Bitcoin clients using in order to find their peers? I learnt that BitTorrent clients may rely on central computers called trackers. Do Bitcoin clients need any kind of central servers or nodes in order to operate?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

                                                                                            
835   &lt;p&gt;Some people keep evangelizing that Bitcoin transaction fees are much lower than in PayPal or with credit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, once nearly all 21 million bitcoins have been mined, the network will still have to be secured.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But &quot;miners&quot; can then no longer be rewarded by newly minted bitcoins. They will have to be rewarded by transaction fees.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I read that the market will find the equilibrium how much these transaction fees will be.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Are there any estimates or more concrete calculations about that? Is it even possible to foresee, as the &quot;degree of network security&quot; is a rather nebulous incentive for most (casual) users? Will they thus be enforced by the software? Will these fees better be absolute or relative to the amount of a single transfer?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

86    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a question many people ask when they're introduced to Bitcoin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin sounds interesting, but if I want to use this system I will need to get some coins, otherwise, there's no way I can spend them! How can I start?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

3290    &lt;p&gt;Bitcoin clients use several methods to locate other clients. The primary method is a list of nodes from a previous connection to the network. The works very well for everything but your first connection or a connection after a very long period of disconnection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the case where you have no previous known IPs or they aren't usable, the primary fallback method is by DNS seeds. Several host names (such as &lt;em&gt;dnsseed.bluematt.me&lt;/em&gt;) are maintained that resolve to a list of IP addresses known to be running nodes. Should that fail, the client has a list of IP addresses believed to point to stable nodes hard-coded into it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One method that used to be used, but that has since been abandoned, was having the clients locate each other using an IRC server. That worked similar to a BitTorrent tracker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you are connected to the network, you will begin to receive lists of IP addresses and ports of known clients.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

849    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I read that the market will find the equilibrium how much these transaction fees will be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It will not.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is perhaps the biggest flaw in Bitcoin at the moment: once mining rewards end there is no direct linkage between the amount of hashpower needed to secure the network and the incentive to mine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;True, there is a limit on the blocksize, so if the transaction volume in a block window (approximately 10 minutes) exceeds the block size you can expect a miniature &quot;auction&quot; where transactions fight for space in the block by bidding up the minimum transaction fee needed to get in.  However this isn't really a closed-loop adjustment: the maximum blocksize is an arbitrarily chosen number, and &lt;strong&gt;there's no reason to believe the maximum blocksize is small enough to ensure that transaction fees are high enough to incent enough miners to mine to keep the system secure&lt;/strong&gt;.  Unlike the difficulty and the USD/BTC exchange rate it does not respond to market activity.  It also has the negative side effect of capping the worldwide Bitcoin transaction throughput since other parts of the protocol rely on the assumption that blocks are created -- in the long run -- no more than once every ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compare this to the current situation with mining rewards: the more valuable a bitcoin is the more incentive there is for somebody to try to overwhelm the &quot;good guys&quot; by gaining 50%+1 hashpower.  However, the more valuable a bitcoin is the more miners will mine!  It isn't perfect, but &lt;strong&gt;the important point is that the demand for security increases the incentive to mine&lt;/strong&gt;.  Note that although the difficulty will go up, that simply ensures that the reward granted every ten minutes is an approximately constant number of BTC -- the number of terahashes/sec fighting over that amount of BTC is free to respond to changes in their changing value (as measured in terms of all other goods in the world, including other currencies).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the mining reward is reduced this &quot;direct coupling&quot; between the network's need for security and the incentive to mine becomes progressively more diluted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I worry a lot about what will happen to Bitcoin once we decouple those two forces.  I think the developers ought to at least come up with a story on how this will be solved so people can start testing it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

93    &lt;h1&gt;Exchanges&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use an online exchange such as the following for US dollars&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitstamp.net&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;BitStamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://campbx.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;CampBX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As well as many others for dollars, and other currencies.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Buying_bitcoins&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;the wiki&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of ways to buy bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Brokerage Services&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Brokerage services allow you to buy or sell directly from them instead of relying on a third party to offer the trade with the exchange just taking a cut. Two such services are&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://coinbase.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://harbor.ly&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;QuadrigaCX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Local / In Person&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use tools such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://localbitcoins.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;localbitcoins.com&lt;/a&gt; to find people near you who will trade cash for bitcoins. &lt;em&gt;(Note, however, that localbitcoins strongly encourages you to use their service despite the fact bitcoin does not require using a 3rd party to do in person transactions)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;IRC and Remote Trades&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;http://bitcoin-otc.com&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;bitcoin-otc&lt;/a&gt;'s web of trust system to improve the likelihood of a successful long distance trade.  This could help you do trades with people you find on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IRC_channels&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;IRC channels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://bitcointalk.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;Bitcoin Forum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Hardware Mining&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mining bitcoins is very technical, and not for many people.  Unless you already have the hardware and technical skill to set it up I would not recommend mining as a way to get bitcoins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Cloud Mining&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It may be worth investigating cloud mining options such as provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cex.io&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer&quot;&gt;CEX.io&lt;/a&gt;.  This type of market provides a trade platform for buying and trading hashing power in terms of GHS/BTC (Giga hashes per second per bitcoin).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Accept Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe by far the best way to get bitcoins is to provide goods and services for bitcoin.  This stimulates the bitcoin economy which in turn makes the bitcoins you receive more valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;

389   &lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;: No. The argument is basically that hoarding will make Bitcoins so valuable that nobody will be willing to offer people enough to part with them. Does that pass the giggle test? Another way of stating the argument is this, &quot;If gold is $2,000/oz today but people think it will be $5,000/oz next year, nobody will trade any gold today.&quot; Again, think about it. Does that pass the giggle test either?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hoarding increases the value of Bitcoins, increasing the profits from mining. This encourages more people to mine, increasing the total hashing power and thus the security of the system. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also makes holding Bitcoins more profitable. This helps to encourage people to accept them in trade because they are less worried about them decreasing in value while they are holding them. Using Bitcoins as a currency inevitably means people sometimes have to hold them and having them drop in value while you hold them is a risk. Hoarding reduces this risk. But it also makes it harder to price things in Bitcoins because the value will tend to change more. Merchants don't like to change their prices twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to claims, it should not affect the trading volume or the willingness of people to use Bitcoins to pay for things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The argument that increasing value means people would prefer to hold Bitcoins rather than spend them is specious. While it will make people want to have Bitcoins more, it will also make people want to convince others to give them Bitcoins more so they can have them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think about it, do people prefer to pay for goods in dollars or garbage? By the reasoning of this argument, they should prefer to pay for goods in garbage, since they'd rather hold their dollars and get rid of their garbage. But, of course, people don't like paying in garbage because nobody &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; garbage. If you can pay with the currency others want, you can get a better deal. So you actually prefer to spend the currencies sellers most &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Bitcoins are valuable because inflation doesn't deprive them of value, then a merchant would rather get my Bitcoins than my dollars, so he'll accept fewer of them. This will cancel out the effect of me preferring to pay in dollars rather than Bitcoins. So it should be a wash.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, put another way, whatever the present and future prospects, there should always be some equivalence between dollars and Bitcoins that people roughly agree on. So whether I pay X dollars or Y bitcoins, where X and Y are in this ratio, will purely depend on whether I prefer the characteristics of dollars or Bitcoins for the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A consequence of this is that hoarding won't negatively affect the trading volume either because that's only dependent on people's use of Bitcoins to buy and sell things. If hoarding makes Bitcoins worth twice as much, only half as many will be used to buy and sell things and the volume (the total value traded) will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't believe it's lost opportunity either. It's not like people who want to trade Bitcoins can't get them because they're all being hoarded. (Nor will it ever be likely to be an issue, since that would just raise the price and thus fewer would be needed. Bitcoins have effectively unlimited divisibility.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why do so many people think currency hoarding is bad? Because it &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; is, and empiric studies even show that it is. But the logic of why currency hoarding is bad doesn't apply to Bitcoins, especially when it's a minority currency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bitcoins are different enough from physical fiat currencies that empirical studies don't apply unless the suspected mechanisms for the observed effects are believed to apply to Bitcoins too. For example, if a penny were enough money to buy a car, how useful would dollars be?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  

2975  &lt;p&gt;It is possible to brute force some Bitcoin addresses, because some people generate their private keys in an insecure manner.  Any (non-zero) 32 bytes can be a private key.  So running sha256 over a passphrase gives an apparently random, but brute force-able private key.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take sha256(&quot;sausage&quot;) for instance:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ echo -n 'sausage' | sha256sum&#xA;30caae2fcb7c34ecadfddc45e0a27e9103bd7cfc87730d7818cc096b1266a683  -&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Load up &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bitaddress.org/&quot;&gt;bitaddress&lt;/a&gt; and paste that private key into the 'wallet details' tab to get the corresponding Bitcoin address, then look it up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blockexplorer.com/address/1TnnhMEgic5g4ttrCQyDopwqTs4hheuNZ&quot;&gt;blockexplorer&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ GET http://blockexplorer.com/q/getreceivedbyaddress/1TnnhMEgic5g4ttrCQyDopwqTs4hheuNZ; echo&#xA;0.01000000&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and you'll see that the address held one bitcent for about 2 days in February 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also: &quot;fuckyou&quot;, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://blockexplorer.com/address/1LdgTMX2MEqdfT3VcDpX4GyD1mqCP8LkYe&quot;&gt;held 2.5 bitcents&lt;/a&gt; for 12 festive days at the turn of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So in practice it's possible to brute force bitcoin address creation, but only for poorly chosen passphrases.  These were probably just people playing around with the idea of &quot;storing bitcoins in their head&quot; which is why they are for such small amounts, and why they weren't left funded for long.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No address balances were harmed in the making of this answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;         

874   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mining&lt;/em&gt; is doing the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; of finding &lt;em&gt;nonce&lt;/em&gt; so that &lt;em&gt;sha256(sha256(data+nonce)) &amp;lt; difficulty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;nonce&lt;/em&gt; is an integer number the miner chooses freely (this choosing of the nonce and checking if the condition (&lt;em&gt;&amp;lt; difficulty&lt;/em&gt;) is met comprises the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; is a hash over the contents of the block (transactions) and the previous block's hash&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;sha256()&lt;/em&gt; is the SHA-256 cryptographic hashing function (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2&quot;&gt;wikpedia SHA-2 article&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;difficulty&lt;/em&gt; is a value that is adjusted consensually by the nodes of the bitcoin network to adjust for change in network computation power in order to have one block every 10 minutes found by the network&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The resulting &lt;em&gt;nonce&lt;/em&gt; is the &lt;em&gt;proof of work&lt;/em&gt;: since it's impossible to find &lt;em&gt;nonce&lt;/em&gt; without essentially trying different &lt;em&gt;nonces&lt;/em&gt; and calculating the two hash functions, having found a &lt;em&gt;nonce&lt;/em&gt; that satisfies the condition is proof this &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; of searching and calculating has in fact been done. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the central idea behind Bitcoin to solve the double spending problem: due to the inclusion of the previous block's hash in &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; (this links the blocks to form a chain) and the fact that the honest nodes of the network always do their &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; on the longest chain of blocks, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending&quot;&gt;double spending&lt;/a&gt; attack involves calculating (and later publishing) a forked block chain in secret that is longer than the &quot;honest chain&quot; (containing the transaction that should be undone). &#xA;Due to the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; required to do this, this race can only be won if the attacker has greater computation power than the rest of the network together. Since using such computation power to honestly mine is likely more profitable than pulling a double-spend, the incentive for doing a double-spend attack is low.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;
